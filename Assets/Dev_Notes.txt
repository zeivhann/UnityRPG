RPG Game Development notes:
General Notes that I wanted to make to keep things on track.


============= Aspects of Gameplay/ Hierarchies =============
I. Interactables - This is the class that every interactable object in the game inherits from. This will include doors, chests, items, NPCs, etc. Interactions are completed using left-click.

II. Items - These are objects that can go into your inventory and they will all inherit from the base Item class. The Item class is based on Unity's ScriptableObject class which enables you to create objects that don't need to be attached to game objects.
[Documentation for ScriptableObject: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html]
	- Create an Item by right-clicking -> Create -> Inventory -> Item. From here, in the inspector the name, sprite in inventory and other item attributes can be set.

III. Navigation - Navigation is done by using a NavMeshRenderer that's built into Unity. The player can walk around to various points on the map and interact with objects by left-clicking.

IV. Inventory - The inventory is handled as its own class with a member variable list. This list contains the items in the inventory and how many items can be held in the inventory. It works by being attached to a GameManger in the scene. The class uses a singleton to call itself and act as a global variable so we don't have to find InstanceOf inventory. This ensures that we have a consistent inventory, and that we can always find it.
[Documentation for Singletons: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Singleton]
	- The inventory is actually kept track of by the GameManager object which holds the list and the list is accessed globablly and affected by lower parts of the hierarchy, typically through interactions with the inventory UI.
	- The Inventory UI is created by drawing on a pane that uses a grid system and a prefab. The icons are selected and enabled based on looping through the list. If the item is in the list, the UI uses its attributes to draw it onto the pane, otherwise the UI simply empties the contents of the rest of the slots. In its current state, the bag is static and has a specific number of slots.
	- The Inventory class holds the attributes of the inventory itself and notifies when the inventory has been altered in some way. This class also holds the actual list of inventory items.
	- The InventoryUI class puts the items in the UI using a loop and sets the keybindings for showing and hiding the inventory. (The bag is initially hidden by disabling it in the Unity editor).
	- The InventorySlot class holds the attributes and functions of each inventory slot itself--adding and removing items, as well as using items and the given attributes of the item, such as its sprite and name.


============= Other Scripts =============
1. Float - When put on a game object, floats up and down based on a given offset. Values can be set in editor.
2. CameraController - This script controls the camera. Allows for zooming in and out and panning around in a circle around the player.




NOTE: Currently the context menu classes are placeholders for implementation later
Right now I'm trying to implement a context menu on left click in the inventory.

-> Maybe use a universal context menu handler (HandleContextMenu attached to GameManager like the inventory?) and call it in the Use function in Item class; the context menu would come from here based on the item's status.
