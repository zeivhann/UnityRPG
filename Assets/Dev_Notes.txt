RPG Game Development notes:
General Notes that I wanted to make to keep things on track.


============= Aspects of Gameplay/ Hierarchies =============
I. Interactables - This is the class that every interactable object in the game inherits from. This will include doors, chests, items, NPCs, etc. Interactions are completed using left-click.

II. Items - These are objects that can go into your inventory and they will all inherit from the base Item class. The Item class is based on Unity's ScriptableObject class which enables you to create objects that don't need to be attached to game objects.
[Documentation for ScriptableObject: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html]
	- Create an Item by right-clicking -> Create -> Inventory -> Item. From here, in the inspector the name, sprite in inventory and other item attributes can be set.

III. Navigation - Navigation is done by using a NavMeshRenderer that's built into Unity. The player can walk around to various points on the map and interact with objects by left-clicking.

IV. Inventory - The inventory is handled as its own class with a member variable list. This list contains the items in the inventory and how many items can be held in the inventory. It works by being attached to a GameManger in the scene. The class uses a singleton to call itself and act as a global variable so we don't have to find InstanceOf inventory. This ensures that we have a consistent inventory, and that we can always find it.

============= Other Scripts =============
1. Float - When put on a game object, floats up and down based on a given offset. Values can be set in editor.
2. CameraController - This script controls the camera. Allows for zooming in and out and panning around in a circle around the player.
